.. IMPORTANT::
    The local :term:`synchronization` will not publish your :term:`resource`\ s and :term:`sitemap`\ s. For that,
    :term:`resource`\ s and :term:`sitemap`\ s must be made available on a web server.
    The export page offers two methods to export :term:`resource`\ s and :term:`sitemap`\ s from your local or networked
    drive to your web server.
